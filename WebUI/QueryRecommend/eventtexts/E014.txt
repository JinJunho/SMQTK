Event name: Repairing an appliance

Definition: One or more people make repairs to a household appliance

Explication: Appliances are machines that are used for functions related to
the maintenance or care of a home or office (e.g. cleaning,
cooling/heating), or to assist people in performing a household task
(e.g. cooking, washing). Major household appliances are typically large and
are often metallic, black or white in color, and may include: air
conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers, drying cabinet, freezer,
refrigerator, kitchen stove, water heater, washing machine, trash
compactor, microwave ovens and induction cookers. Non-major household
appliances are typically small appliances that perform a more specialized
task, and include: coffee makers, toasters, stand mixers, food
processors. Repairs to these items may include removing and replacing a
part, or adjusting a part without replacing it.

Small machines that are held and moved with the hand while operating them,
such as hand mixers, hair dryers, or electric toothbrushes, may also be
considered appliances. Large, permanently-installed machines that perform
household tasks (e.g. a garage door opener, a central heating/cooling unit)
are also not usually classified as appliances. Finally, machines primarily
used for entertainment rather than household tasks, such as televisions, CD
and DVD players, cameras, clocks, video game consoles, home cinema systems,
telephones, answering machines, etc. are not generally considered
appliances.
